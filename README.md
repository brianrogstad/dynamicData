# Dynamic Data App
JSON and jQuery App that I built from scratch as a learning process to keep progressing my JavaScript skills.

This App takes JSON data from two different files, processes the data and using a constructor method to simplify the data structure.

From there the data it's sent to an intermediate array for use in rendering the data.
The DOM is then mostly built using for loops to construct two data tables.


## Requirements
- jQuery (provided by CDN)
- Bootstrap (provided by CDN)

- Local Server (for running for Ajax)
I recommend using Python as a quick way to run a local server, there are other ways but python is very quick and painless


## Start App
Clone repo and run the content locally
```bash
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
visit localhost://8000 to view the project

# Dynamic Data App
JSON and jQuery App that I built from scratch as a learning process to keep progressing my JavaScript skills.
Server and middleware used is Node and Express. Server is required to make Ajax calls.

This App takes JSON data from two different files, processes the data and using a constructor method to simplify the data structure.

From there the data it's sent to an intermediate array for use in rendering the data.
The DOM is then mostly built using for loops to construct two data tables.


## Requirements
- Install Node


## Start App
